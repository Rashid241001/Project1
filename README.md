This is a basic Rock–Paper–Scissors game implemented in Python where a user plays against the computer. 
The program demonstrates core Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, user input handling, and random selection.

The program allows the user to play three rounds of Rock–Paper–Scissors against the computer. For each round, the computer randomly chooses between rock, paper, and scissors. The user is prompted to enter their choice,
and the input is validated to ensure it is one of the allowed options.

A function is used to determine the winner of each round by comparing the user’s choice with the computer’s choice. 
The result is then displayed as a win, loss, or tie based on standard game rules.

Key Concepts Used

Lists to store valid choices

Functions to organize game logic

Conditional statements to determine the winner

Loops for repeated gameplay

Input validation to handle incorrect user input

Random selection using Python’s built-in random module

Requirements..

Python 3 or higher is required to run this program. No external libraries are needed.

Usage..

Run the Python file and follow the on-screen instructions to enter your choice for each round. The game will automatically progress through three rounds and display the result of each one.

Purpose..

This project is intended for beginners who want to practice Python fundamentals and understand how simple games are built using basic programming concepts.
